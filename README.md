# Kelp Commons License

Kelp Commons is a [Fair-Code license](https://faircode.io) and was created for the [Kelp UI library](https://kelpui.com).

**[View the License &rarr;](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp-commons/blob/main/LICENSE.md)**


## What

Like an open source license, it allows users to view, modify, and redistribute the source code, but _only_ for non-commercial purposes. Commercial use requires a separate license. 

Kelp Commons also prohibits use for projects that cause physical, social, or environmental harm.


## Why

I believe that code belongs in the commons. I also believe that pro-capitalist traditional open source software (OSS) licenses allow big corporations to exploit the labor of small creators while giving them little or nothing back in return.

Traditional OSS licenses also allow your work to be used for wildly unethical things with little-to-no resource.

Kelp Commons, like all Fair-Code licenses, attempts to bridge that gap.


## Credits

It was inspired by the [n8n Sustainable Use license](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md), the [Kirby CMS license](https://getkirby.com/license/2025-03-18), and the [Ethical Source project](https://ethicalsource.dev).
